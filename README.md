## Project Overview

This project analyzes over a decade of patient data (2011–2022) from **Massachusetts General Hospital**, comprising approximately **1,000 patient records** with details on encounters, costs, insurance coverage, and procedures.  

The analysis is structured around three key objectives:

1. **Encounters Overview** : Explore encounter trends by **year**, **encounter class**, and **encounter length** to understand hospital activity and patient flow patterns.  
2. **Cost & Coverage Insights** : Examine **payer coverage**, identify **top procedures**, and analyze **claim cost trends** to reveal areas of financial inefficiency and coverage gaps.  
3. **Patient Behavior Analysis** : Assess **quarterly admissions** and **readmission patterns** to gain insight into patient behavior and care continuity.

By investigating these dimensions, the project provides a comprehensive view of hospital performance, uncovering data-driven insights that support **strategic planning**, **cost optimization**, and **quality improvement** across the healthcare system.

## Key Insights Summary
- Identified **49% of encounters without payer coverage**, representing an estimated **$75M in potential annual revenue losses**.  
- Observed a **164% increase in patient volume** over the 10-year period, indicating significant growth in hospital utilization.  
- Detected **771 readmissions within 30 days** during 2021, signaling elevated patient return rates and potential care quality gaps.  
- Recommended revenue recovery strategies, such as pre-visit insurance verification and targeted case management for high-risk patient groups.
- Delivered data-driven insights to inform hospital operations, cost optimization, and patient care improvement.

## Key Findings

### Revenue Coverage Gaps
- **Payer Coverage:** Nearly **49% of all encounters (13,586 visits)** occurred without payer coverage, exposing the hospital to significant revenue risk across nearly half of its activity.  
- **Reimbursement Variability:** Reimbursement rates vary widely across payers. **Medicaid** delivers the highest average reimbursement at **$6,205 per encounter**, while **Dual Eligible** patients generate the lowest at **$1,696**.  
- **Uninsured Impact:** Uninsured patients report average claims of **$5,593**, much of which remains uncollectable—further emphasizing revenue leakage concerns.

### Cost Structure & Procedure Trends
- **Standardized Pricing:** Most high-volume procedures maintain a consistent operational cost of approximately **$431 per procedure**, including:  
  - Health assessments (4,596 procedures)  
  - Hospice care (4,098)  
  - Depression screening (3,614)  
- **Outlier Procedure:** **Renal dialysis** stands out with **2,746 procedures** averaging **$1,004 each**, nearly **2.5× higher** than the standard cost—highlighting the resource-intensive nature of chronic kidney disease management.

---

### Patient Safety Concerns
- **Readmissions:** A total of **771 patients** were readmitted within **30 days** of discharge.  
- **Extreme Cases:** The most severe case involved a single patient with **1,376 readmissions**, representing serious safety risks and inefficient resource utilization.

---

### Operational Efficiency
- **Encounter Growth:** Annual encounters increased from **1,336 in 2011** to **3,530 in 2021**, a **164% growth** over the decade.  
- **Quarterly Trends (2021):** Patient encounters peaked in **Q1 (417)** and **Q2 (414)** before declining in **Q3 (279)** and **Q4 (223)**, suggesting both increased patient volume and higher visit frequency early in the year.  
- **Duration Performance:** **96% of encounters** concluded within **24 hours**, reflecting strong throughput management and effective discharge planning.  
- **Service Line Distribution:**  
  - **Ambulatory care** dominated hospital operations, ranging from **36.9% (2021)** to **60.3% (2014)**.  
  - **Outpatient services** spiked to **40.2% (2021)**, signaling temporary operational shifts.  
  - **Urgent care** rose sharply from **2.2% (2011)** to **17.8% (2019)**.  
  - **Emergency care** remained steady between **4–11%**.  
  - **Wellness care** declined from **13.0% (2011)** to **4.4% (2021)**.  
  - **Inpatient care** fell from **6.2% to 1.6%**, reflecting the shift toward ambulatory and outpatient treatment models.

##  Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Reduce Revenue Leakage**
Implement **automated insurance verification** 24–48 hours prior to visits to address the **49% uninsured encounter rate**. This process could recover substantial lost revenue and should be prioritized as a key financial control measure.

### 2. **Target High-Risk Patient Groups**
Deploy **case management programs** for patients with **30-day readmissions**, focusing especially on the top **5 high-frequency cases** averaging nearly **800 readmissions each**. Enhanced care coordination can lower costs, mitigate safety risks, and improve overall outcomes.

### 3. **Optimize Payer Strategy**
With **Dual Eligible** patients reimbursing only **$1,696 per encounter** compared to **$6,205 for Medicaid**, the hospital should:  
- Negotiate improved reimbursement rates with low-paying insurers.  
- Strategically focus on **patients with higher-reimbursing coverage** to improve revenue sustainability.  
- Leverage payer-mix analytics for more balanced and profitable service distribution.
